Key Learnings from the Project
Approaching this web development project as a newcomer, I dedicated a week to thoroughly understanding the fundamentals of web development. This initial phase, spanning the first week of the project timeline, focused on acquiring a deep comprehension of web development and gaining insights into its diverse components. Empowered with this newfound knowledge, the subsequent week was committed to formulating and implementing the project.

Frameworks Acquired in the Initial Week
HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)
Additionally, I gained proficiency in applying concepts such as flexbox, CSS grid, Z-indexing, and positioning.

Undoubtedly, encountering challenges was inevitable during this inaugural venture into web development.

Challenges Encountered
Grasping concepts like flexbox and CSS grid proved to be challenging.
Crafting the user interface for the website posed difficulties.
Git and GitHub introduced confusion due to their abstract nature, making it challenging to comprehend the processes transpiring "behind the scenes."
Despite these challenges, I successfully generated a tangible outcome, and I take pride in the accomplishments. This experience served as a significant challenge that fueled the growth of my passion for web development.

Future Advancements
This project signifies a starting point. Looking ahead, my intentions include:

Expanding the website's functionality, ensuring responsiveness, and transforming it into a fully operational website with a backend.
Elevating the user interface to achieve a more refined and polished appearance.
